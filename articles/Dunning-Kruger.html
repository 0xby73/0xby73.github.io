    <h1>The Dunning-kruger effect</h1>


    <p>
    I find it funny how people learn the bare basics of a particular topic,<br>
    then exclaim that they possess a clairvoyant grasp of it as if<br>
    they were omniscient of some sort.<br><br>

    Suprisingly, this isn't just a weak minded soyboy's partial narcissism bringing<br>
    itself into light, it's a phenomenon called the "Dunning-kruger effect"<br><br>

    <h2>Brief explanation</h2>
   
    <img src="https://0xby73.github.io/pix/Dunning.png"></a>
    <p>
    This phenomenon shows itself in most people but the main focus is "Mount ignorance".<br>
    It's the highest point of confidence in oneselfs ability although at this point<br>
    is when you most commonly lack the knowledge of even the basics.<br><br>

    This is a problem.<br>

    Especially on social media applicatons like Tiktok where short form media is more prominent.<br>
    People using short form content in the sense of entertainment have a larger problem in general<br>
    but it's not uncommon for the average user to be gullible enough to fall for most of the media <br>
    that they intake.<br><br>

    Now this is obviously a problem in general but in the context of the Dunning-kruger effect, it doesnt<br>
    help the current case.<br><br>

    Due to the current nature of social media algorithms and the attention span of the normies who<br>
    arent able to watch a video explaining something in depth for more than 20 seconds, videos from<br>
    people who try to feed you the tiktok "red pill" in which it's always someone with barley enough<br>
    knowledge to be talking about anything they seem to have a passion of preaching about.<br><br>

    This can lead to some inconveniences of some know-it-all goobers parading around with misinformation,<br>
    but it's main problem; due to how gullible people are these days, it tends to create a ripple effect <br>
    of people with even lesser knowledge trying to advertise semi-factual information they gathered from <br>
    a highly uncredited source (A larp mentor on tiktok) instead of doing even the tiniest form of research <br>
    to give credit to the original source.<br><br>

    Things like this don't always end up horrible but like a game of chinese whispers, the original message<br>
    always ends up getting scrambled until its something completely offset from what was originally stated<br><br>
