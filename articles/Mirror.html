If you're planning an attack on someone, mainly social engineering, you need to make your
plan as dumb as your target

You cant be too sophisticated or else your extra plans would fail to work as well as something
simpler since your target wasn't intelligent enough to try think ahead and fall into a trap
you planted

Think basketball

If you've ever seen something uneducated in defenses or any fancy maneuver get put up to someone
trying to do fancy ballet moves to try and "fool you", to no avail, as you arent trying to
predict their next move or perform any counters to a pattern you've encountered before due to
the fact you have minimal knowledge

This applies the same way in most cases
